Interactive Problem - 
A problem where your solutions interacts with a grader. (problem judge)

Interacting with the judge-
1. When we print output on console/screen, expensive project.
2. Language try to store the output(buffer output).
3. When the program terminates, it prints all the output in one go.

If you want to flush the output everytime- then use cout<<flush; (if using cin and cout).

endl actually works as cout<<'\n'<<flush; Therefore, it's a little slower

We use:
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    cout.tie(NULL);
